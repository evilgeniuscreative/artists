- When navigating to InputForm, we need to pass in header title to indicate what data we're touching
- update handleSubmit in InputForm, so data will update on submit in edit page
- look for additional ways of refactoring code to make it as reusuable as possible (may or may not exist)
- look into Formik arrays in the documentation

Next time
- refactor formik form
- refactor tableview to utilize formik array
